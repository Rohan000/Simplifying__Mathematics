Expression or 'abhivyakti' as it is called in Hindi , I think is the need of the hour. In the times that Bharat(India) sees, the 
prevalence or rather dominance of a blank ego throughout the systems has dug a pit for an otherwise bright and prosperous future of a 
rich and ancient cultural heritage. From 'Om Guruve namah' , we have come to imposing discipline as a way of life in academic institutions.
In comparing gurus to god and filling ourselves blindly either with pride or with despair for political parlour tricks , we have dropped 
the torch of truth , upon which the entire culture has forever been based. Buddha put it quite simply , neither the one who believes in god 
nor the one who disbelieves , because both claim to know something they actually don't. This is all , the national slogan says 'Satyamev 
Jayate', Let Truth Alone Triumph. For the sake of humanity and that of the nation , I hope the masses rise above the narratives and in 
pursuit of truth.
